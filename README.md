The Surman Lab is an interdisciplinary research group led by [Andrew Surman](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/andrew-surman). We are based in the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/chemistry) at King's College, London. 

Our interests are broad, but centre on Supramolecular Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Systems Chemistry, and an affinity for horrible messes which nobody else wants to deal with. We are applying these as tools to solve practical problems (understanding heterogenous industrial materials, environmental & medical diagnostics) and more fundamental questions (especially around the Origin of Life).
